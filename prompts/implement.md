# Implement with tools

You are in a fresh Rust library workspace. Use the available tools; do not merely return code as text. First call read_file with path `src/lib.rs`, then write_file with path `src/lib.rs` and the complete implementation including unit tests. Call run_task with task `test` to run the real tests. If tests fail, read_file, edit with write_file, and call run_task again. Continue until tests pass or you cannot fix them. Do not edit Cargo.toml. Finish with a short summary of what you actually changed and tested.
